### Step 4 - "Log into ieng6"

`\t` *Keys pressed*: ``` ssh cs15lwi23abo@ieng6.ucsd.edu<enter> ```
`\t` I just typed all texts to log into ieng6.

### Step 5 - "Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account"

`\t` *Keys pressed*: ``` git<space>clone<space><command + v><enter> ```
`\t` I copied the **SSH** of forked repository called `lab7`. Then paste that after typing `git clone`. This allows me to clone my fork of the repository.

`\t` [1] `ls`
`\t` *Keys pressed*: ``` ls<enter> ```
`\t` I typed `ls` to check if cloning worked well. `ls` command shows me the direcotry and file list, and I checked the folder called `lab7`.  

`\t` [2] `cd lab7`
`\t` *Keys pressed*: ``` cd<space>lab7<enter> ```
`\t` Then I moved my working directory to `lab7` folder by typing `cd lab7`.

`\t` [3] `ls`
`\t` *Keys pressed*: ``` ls<enter> ```
`\t` I typed `ls` to check which files and direcotries are inside the `lab7` folder. This was to see certain file's name later on step 6. 

### Step 6 - "Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail" 

### Step 7 - "Edit the code file to fix the failing test" 

### Step 8 - "Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed" 

### Step 9 - "Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account"
