## Week 1 Lab Report
by Jaewon Han 

Throughout this 15L course, we'll use course-specific account. 

This post is a tutorial about how to log into a course-specific account on `ieng6`.

### Part 1 - CSE15L Account
First of all, you should check your course-specific account for CSE15L.

You can find your account using this link: [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php]

After logging into the website above, you should change your account to the additional account starting with `cse15l`.

Then, you have to reset the password. If you've reset the password, you have to wait a few minutes(usually 15 mins) for it to take effect. 

### Part 2 - VS code
